Bugs

The taskbar icons do not unfocus even after the state being changed.
The state is being updated but the Taskbar Component is not being re-rendered.



Unfinished Features

On opening multiple windows, multiple icons of the same applcation appear in the taskbar which is not the expected behaviour at all. Needs to be taken care of.
